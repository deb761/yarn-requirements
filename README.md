# YarnRequirements

Quickly estimate the amount of yarn you need for a project when you are out shopping for yarn or gazing at your stash and trying to figure out if you have enough of that wool to make a sweater for your niece.  The Yarn estimator handles both Imperial and metric units, and a mixture of the two, as well.
The full version calculates estimates for the following projects:
- Sweaters
- Vests
- Scarves
- Blankets
- Tams (Berets)
- Toques (ski caps)
- Socks
- Mittens
- Gloves
